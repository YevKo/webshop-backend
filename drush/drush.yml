# A Drush configuration file

# Docs at https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/master/examples/example.drush.yml
#
# Edit or remove this file as needed.

# In production or staging environments, this setting should be changed.
# In order to git not complain about this changed file, run this command:
# git update-index --assume-unchanged drush/drush.yml
# If you need to update this file with other settings, you can just commit them
# and pull them in production or staging. But bear in mind that the changes
# done on those environments would be missed, and you will have to run the
# previous command again.

# Replace the 'uri' with the value displayed by running the command 'ddev describe'.
